## 🔧 Development Setup

### 📋 **Prerequisites**
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git for version control
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)

### 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ashutosh-engineer/med-genie.git
   cd med-genie
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment setup:**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use the automated setup script (recommended)
   npm run setup-env
   
   # Option 2: Manual setup
   # Copy environment template
   cp env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env file with your configuration:
   # - JWT_SECRET (required for authentication - auto-generated by setup script)
   # - DATABASE_URL (SQLite by default)
   # - Other optional settings
   ```

4. **Database setup:**
   ```bash
   # Generate Prisma client
   npx prisma generate
   
   # Create and migrate database
   npx prisma db push
   
   # (Optional) View database in Prisma Studio
   npx prisma studio
   ```

5. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Access the application:**
   - Main app: `http://localhost:9003`
   - AI development: `npm run genkit:dev`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Build Errors**
- **JWT_SECRET error**: Run `npm run setup-env` to generate environment variables
- **Database connection issues**: Ensure Prisma client is generated with `npx prisma generate`
- **Port conflicts**: Change port in `package.json` scripts if 9003 is occupied

### **Common Issues**
- **Authentication not working**: Verify JWT_SECRET is set in your environment
- **Database errors**: Run `npx prisma db push` to sync database schema
- **Build failures**: Clear `.next` folder and run `npm run build` again

### 🔐 **Authentication Setup**

The application includes a complete authentication system:

- **User Registration**: Create accounts with email/password
- **Secure Login**: JWT-based authentication
- **Protected Routes**: Homepage requires authentication
- **Session Management**: Persistent login across browser sessions
- **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds

**Default Environment Variables:**
```env
# Authentication (Required)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d

# Database (Auto-configured for development)
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# AI Features (Required for chat functionality)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_here
```
